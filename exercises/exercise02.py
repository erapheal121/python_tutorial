Question 1
Write a program that reverse the list below
list1 = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]

Expected Output:
[500, 400, 300, 200, 100]


Question 2
Write a program to add two lists index-wise.
Create a new list that contains the 0th index item from both the list,
then the 1st index item, and so on till the
last element. any leftover items will get added at the end of the new list.

list1 = ["P", "y", "t", "h"]
list2 = ["o", "n"," ", "R", "ocks"]

Expected Output:
["P", "y", "t", "h", "o", "n", " ", "R", "ocks"]

Question 3
Write a program to add item 4000 after 3000 in the following Python List

list1 = [10, 20, [300, 400, [2000, 3000], 500], 30, 40]

Expected Output:
[10, 20, [300, 400, [2000, 3000, 4000], 500], 30, 40]

Question 4
You have given a nested list. 
list1 = ["a", "b", ["c", ["d", "e", ["f", "g"], "k"], "l"], "m", "n"]

Write a program to extend it by adding the sublist ["h", "i", "j"] 
in such a way that it will look like the following list.

Expected Output:
['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], 'k'], 'l'], 'm', 'n']

Question 5
You have given a Python list.
Write a program to find value 10 in the list, and if it is present,
replace it with 100. Only update the first occurrence of an item.

list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 10]
#Expected Output:
[5, 100, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100]

Question 6
Given a Python list, write a program to remove all occurrences of item 20.
list1 = [5, 20, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]

Expected Output:
[5, 15, 25, 50]
